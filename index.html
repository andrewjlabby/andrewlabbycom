Hi. You probably got this link from a resume or a friend who said  
"I think this guy might be kind of smart or possibly insane."

Let’s set expectations: <strong>no startup hype</strong> here.  
<strong>No animations, no mission statements, no inflated buzzwords.</strong> Just me.  
I write code. I build systems. I keep things running.  
<strong>It’s not complicated, but it matters.</strong>

Here’s a photo of me smiling on a mountain.  
Because <strong>climbing mountains is what I do — technically and metaphorically.</strong>  
(Yes, I really did just be that corny. You're still reading, so it worked.)

I <strong>designed, built, and launched frametwo.com</strong> — the first platform  
that scans videos for TOS violations across all major social platforms  
<strong>before</strong> you upload them.  
Wild concept. It works. It ships. People use it.

Before that, I was a <strong>Senior LLM Specialist and Technical Lead at Appen</strong>.  
I handled <strong>large-scale, high-sensitivity data operations</strong>  
for companies like <strong>Apple, Google, Amazon</strong> —  
the kind of work where <strong>failure isn't an option</strong>  
and no one’s got time to explain twice.  
I kept things moving. No drama. No disasters.

I’m not here to oversell.  
I’m here because I like <strong>solving hard problems with people who actually care</strong>  
about doing it right.

If that sounds like the kind of person you want on your team:

&gt; <strong>email</strong>   andrewjlabby@gmail.com  
&gt; <strong>phone</strong>   724-467-8484 (leave a voicemail — I screen calls like it’s still 2009)
