Hey there! Appreciate you stopping by.  
I’ve built a lot of polished web experiences.  
This one’s intentionally stripped down. So the work can speak for itself 
without any crazy animations. So here's a little bit about me:

I build backend systems, ship production-grade tools,  
and get large-scale pipelines to run cleanly and reliably.  
Multi-million-record datasets. Model feedback loops.  
Deadlines that don’t blink. That kind of work.

At Appen, I lead engineering for high-risk LLM and vision projects  
touching clients like <strong>Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta</strong>, and others under NDA.  
I’ve built pipelines that process millions of annotations weekly,  
wrote tools that cut QA time in half,  
and integrated with TensorFlow training systems to keep models production-ready.

Not a sandbox. Not a demo. Real tools for real workflows — under real pressure.

I also launched <strong><a href="https://frametwo.com" target="_blank">frametwo.com</a></strong> — a platform  that pre-screens video content for 
policy violations across YouTube, Meta, TikTok, etc.,  
<strong>before</strong> upload. It’s frame-level, scalable, and fully automated.

People use it. It works. And is always evolving.

I’m based in the U.S., open to relocation.
If the team’s sharp and the work’s got teeth,
I’ll be googling “best grocery stores in [your city]” before the call is over.

I’ve shipped systems at scale, led technical teams through high-stakes delivery,
built tools that saved thousands of hours, and kept critical workflows alive
when failure wasn’t an option.

If you’re looking for someone who can lead, build, adapt, and deliver
without the drama and without the ego, that’s me.

Let’s talk.
