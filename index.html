Hi. You probably got this link from a resume or a friend who said  
"I think this guy might be kind of smart or possibly insane."

Let’s set expectations: no startup hype here.  
No animations, no mission statements, no inflated buzzwords. Just me.  
I write code. I build systems. I keep things running. It’s not complicated, but it matters.

Here’s a photo of me smiling on a mountain.  
Because climbing mountains is what I do — technically and metaphorically.  
(Yes, I really did just be that corny. You're still reading, so it worked.)

I designed, built, and launched frametwo.com — the first platform  
that scans videos for TOS violations across all major social platforms  
*before* you upload them. Wild concept. It works. It ships. People use it.

Before that, I was a Senior LLM Specialist and Technical Lead at Appen.  
I handled large-scale, high-sensitivity data operations  
for companies like Apple, Google, Amazon —  
the kind of work where failure isn't an option and no one’s got time to explain twice.  
I kept things moving. No drama. No disasters.

I’m not here to oversell. I’m here because I like solving hard problems  
with people who actually care about doing it right.

If that sounds like the kind of person you want on your team:

> email   andrewjlabby@gmail.com  
> phone   724-467-8484 (leave a voicemail — I screen calls like it’s still 2009)
