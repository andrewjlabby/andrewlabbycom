Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.  
I’ve spent way too much time making other websites pixel-perfect,  
so this one’s intentionally minimal — kind of a palate cleanser.

If you’re into clarity over flash, you’ll feel at home here.

No startup fluff. No mission statements. No chasing trends.  
Just the work I care about and the way I show up to do it.

I build backend systems, ship production tools,  
and make complex workflows run like clockwork.  
It's low-ego, high-stakes engineering — and I thrive in it.

I designed, built, and launched <strong><a href="https://frametwo.com" target="_blank">frametwo.com</a></strong> — a platform that  
pre-screens videos for TOS violations across major platforms  
<strong>before</strong> you upload them. Simple idea, hard problem. It works.

At Appen, I was a <strong>Senior LLM Specialist and Technical Lead</strong>.  
I managed high-risk data workflows for clients like <strong>Apple, Google, Amazon</strong>.  
These were the kinds of projects where failure wasn’t an option,  
and nobody had time to explain things twice.

I kept things moving. Cleanly, quietly, and on time.

I’m based in the U.S., but I’m open to relocating.  
If the work’s meaningful and the team’s sharp,  
I’ll be looking up grocery stores in your city by tomorrow.
